# 42_school_piscine

Hi folks,

after failing my piscine @42 in germany i still want to continue torturing myself with some C.
I will work my way through the excersises and post the .c files here. But be warned I don't have norminette or moulinette at my disposal. Nontheless i hope the code will be helpful to others preparing for or working on theire piscine.

I work with the no functions allowed rule and a few norm settings but I ignore a good chunk of the original norm eg function length.
If you find errors or if you want to give me tips about writing the stuff in a more elegant way - feel free to contact me.
I started as a counter junky but i try to work more often with pointer now - although i still didn't grasp the concept to 100%.
